      <h1>Building a Volunteer Management Tool for Cascade Bicycle Club</h1>

      <section>
        <h3>About Cascade Bicycle Club</h3>
        <p>
          Cascade Bicycle Club is a Washington state bicycling nonprofit. They
          organize flagship rides and events such as the Seattle to Portland,
          advocate for safe places to ride, and teach the joys of bicycling.
          Cascade serves around 10,000 members, has 30 staff and 700 volunteers.

        <h3>How I got involved</h3>
        <p>
          I wanted to gain hands-on experience in building web applications
          while creating something useful. As a volunteer with Cascade and an
          avid cyclist, I approached Zack, the Volunteer Manager at Cascade to
          explore how I could contribute. During our conversation, we identified
          several areas where a database-powered application could reduce
          repetitive manual tasks through automation.

        <h3>What were the problems</h3>
        <p>
          Volunteer activities and benefits were tracked using multiple Excel
          spreadsheets. Updating these spreadsheets involved merging together
          spreadsheets from various sources and creating pivot tables, making it
          tedious and prone to errors. Consequently, updates were only done once
          a month, leaving volunteers with potentially outdated information
          about their benefitsâ€”sometimes as old as a month.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h3>What I did</h3>
        <p>
          I began by understanding the problems and familiarizing myself with
          the existing processes. The team and I agreed that developing a web
          application with a relational database would not only address the
          current issues but also provide a scalable foundation for future
          enhancements.
        </p>
        <p>
          Based on my understanding of Cascade volunteer team's operation, I
          designed a data model and implemented it using PostgreSQL.
        </p>
        <div class="imgcap">
          <img src="assets/dbdiagram.png" />
        </div>
        <p>
          I created a user interface for the team to manage their operations.
        </p>

          <img src="assets/volunteer-app.png" />
        </div>
        <p>
          I developed additional features, including expiring volunteer credits,
          merging duplicate profiles, capabilities that were previously
          infeasible.
        </p>

        <h3>What was the impact</h3>
        <p>
          Volunteers now have an up-to-date view of their activities and
          benefits. The team has a systematic tool to manage volunteers, events,
          and benefits, eliminating the need for tedious manual tasks.

        <h3>What did I learn?</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>Database design and management</li>
          <p>
            I deepened my understanding of relational databases, including
            concepts like database normalization and SQL query optimization.
            Working with PostgreSQL, I also gained hands-on experience
            implementing databases using an Object-Relational Mapper (ORM) with
            Flask-SQLAlchemy
          </p>
          <li>Collaboration and communication with stakeholders</li>
          <p>
            I learned to translate users' pain points into technical solutions,
            understanding implicit requirements, and anticipating scope creep
            and requirements changes.
          </p>
          <li>User-centered design</li>
          <p>
            I learned to design a simple and intuitive user interface based on
            minimal initial requirements, using iterative improvements and
            regular demos to gather feedback and ensure the final product was
            valuable to the team.
          </p>
        </ol>

        <h3>What did they say about working with me?</h3>
        Here is an except of what Zack Kravey, Volunteer Manager at Cascade
        Bicycle Club has to say:
        <blockquote>
          Mishan's database has laid the groundwork for widespread
          implementation of similar systems across other departments. Mishan is
          a dependable, punctual, professional volunteer who settles for nothing
          but the most optimal solution. She consistently showed a genuine
          interest in the needs of the organization and solicited feedback every
          week on potential improvements.
        </blockquote>
